# RETROSPECTIVES
As a team you will have a retrospective.

During this meeting you will have a discussion with your team members.

You discuss what went well during the last sprint and what should be improved.

Possible questions to get you going:
* On a scale of 1â€“10, how do you feel this sprint went? Why?
* If you could go back in time and do this sprint again, what would you change and what wouldn't you change?
* What about this sprint was the biggest source of stress or difficulty for you personally?
* How did you cope with things that went wrong?
* What was the effect of earlier retrospectives?

In this document you will write down some conclusions.

## First Retrospective [14/05/2025]
* A solid 7
* Everybody thought it went pretty well
* a more concrete plan might be benifitial for next sprint
* we also need to remind ourselves to do standups

## Second Retrospective [28/05/2025]
* Now that we have come across a more concrete plan of what everyone was gonna do, a solid 8
* Maybe communication. We just told eachother what our plan was and that was it
* Nothing really. It went find for me. For others aswell
* When I cope when things go wrong. I ask my other mates if they could help me out with something. The second option is searching on the internet for a solution.
* The effect for the team was that we got closer to talk to eachother

## Third Retrospective [4/05/2025]
* We've talked about the final stuff. We know what to do next
* Nothing really.
* Cant think of anything. Maybe that people have to be in class on time. We've did the standup without 3 people.
* When I cope when things go wrong. I ask my other mates if they could help me out with something. The second option is searching on the internet for a solution.
* Nothing that we can think of
