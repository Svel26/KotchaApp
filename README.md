# Project Physical Computing lol

> This is a project in which game and web developers work together.

> Everyone is asked to do their programming part in the project.

## Collect proof of your work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Any document you create (FDD.md, TDD.md, REVIEW.md, RETROSPECTIVE.md, TEST_RESULT.md and any other document)
* Screenshots of your scrum board during stand-ups (before and after).
* Video of (or parts of) the working application (max 25MB).
* Notes created during meetings.
* ...

## General planning
A planning a scrum master could use:
[GENERAL_PLANNING.md](sintlucas%2FGENERAL_PLANNING.md)

## Complete the FDD (Functional Design Document)
There is an incomplete FDD in the FDD folder.
* Complete this FDD by adding extra the functional requirements and a game play section.
* Let a teacher approve it before you start working on the project.

## Complete the TDD (Technical Design Document)
There is an incomplete FDD in the FDD folder.
* Complete this TDD by refining the functional requirements into technical requirements.

## Prepare
* Create a scrum board in `GitHub Projects` with these columns:
  `sprint backlog (ToDo)`, `in progress`, `testing`, `done`
* Place the refined requirements in `GitHub Issues` (which will act as your backlog).
* Prioritize the backlog items. Use a label in `GitHub Issues` to indicate the priority (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
* Have a Sprint Planning meeting and decide which issues you will address in the coming sprint.
* Move them to the `sprint backlog` column (ToDo) on the scrum board.

## Realise
Start a stand-up meeting every time you begin working on the project (which is probably each lesson):
* Open the scrum board
* Each team member answers these questions:
  * What did you do last time?
  * What will you do today?
  * Are there any impediments in your way?
* Update the scrum board.
* Start developing on the sprint backlog items (ToDo).

> ### Don't forget
> * Commit and push your changes regularly.
> * Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.
> * Make sure that your code follows the code conventions.

## Test
* Perform a User Acceptance Test (UAT) by testing the features in the FDD.

## Review
* Show the result so far to the client (the items in the `Done` column)
* Write down feedback from the client in `REVIEW.md`.
* Add/change items in the Backlog (in Issues) based on the feedback in `REVIEW.md`.

## Retrospective
* You will have a meeting with your team (and teacher) and discuss the process of the project.
* Complete the `RETROSPECTIVE.md` in the `sintlucas` folder.

## Assessment
In the last week your team will present the results:
* Prepare for the presentation (not a PowerPoint presentation, but a live demo of the product).
* You will be individually assessed.
* Prove that you met the criteria in `sintlucas/ASSESSMENT.MD`
* You will be assessed on the criteria in `sintlucas/ASSESSMENT.MD`.
* You will receive feedback on your work.

## Video of your work
Create a video of the working application:
* Before the Presentation & Assessment, you must create a video of the working application.
* The video should show the main functionalities of the application.
* It should be a screencast with a voice-over.
* The video should be maximal 25MB in size.
* Place it in the `sintlucas` folder and name it `video-md-your-names.mp4`.
